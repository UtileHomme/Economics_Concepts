<!-- What is Economics -->
- We have resources in the economy and we wish to understand how those resources will be allocated

<!-- What is MicroEconomics -->
- it is the study of individual actors
- these actors could be firms, households
- how actors make decisions / allocation of scarce resources (Eg - Food, Water, Labour)
- how does it affect prices and everything else
- how people think
- Finally we make some assumptions or simplify the above question-answers

<!-- What is MacroEconomics  -->
- the study of economy in aggregrate
- aggregate economy policy decisions
Eg - What is going to happen when you raise or lower taxes
- How does it affect the overall productivity

<!-- What is Scarcity -->
- Economics is the study of "how we allocate the scarce resources"
- If there's more demand for a scarce resource, determining who gets it, how much of it do they get
and what do they have to give up to get those scarce resources

Eg - Caviar (fish egss) is a scarce resource
- Even "labour" is a resource (it is a scarce resource)

<!-- Difference between Normative and Positive Statements -->

1. Normative Statement
- it is a statement concerned with giving an opinion or involving ethics
- it is how someone thinks the world should be

Eg - Paying People who aren't working, even though they could work, is wrong and unfair
Eg - The govt. should raise taxes on the wealthy to pay for helping the poor

2. Positive Statement
- it doesn't necessarily have to be true but can be tested
Eg - Programs like welfare reduce the incentive for people to work
Eg - Raising taxes on the wealthy to pay for govt. programs grows the economy

<!-- What are the different Economic Models -->
- Models are created to test some parameters for a specific scenario and using the findings from that
experiment make a generalized assumption for a larger populace
- Economists make simplifying assumptions
Eg - all actors in an economy are rational (not necessarily true)

** ceteris paribus
- All other things being equal

** One shouldn't accept economic models as giving a perfect picture of reality

<!-- What are command and market economies -->

1. Command Economy
- the govt. controls that factors of production like farms, factories etc.
- the govt will tell that this year exactly 10,000 cars (no more no less)
- the govt. also decides who gets the output (it might not be the person who can pay the most)
- the prices are more or less fixed

<!-- Advantages of Command Economy -->
- Fairness in delegation of products
- Communism (a theory or system of social organization in which all property is owned by the community
and each person contributes and receives according to their ability and needs)

<!-- Disadvantages of Command Economy -->
- One's new ideas will not be rewareded

2. Market Economy
- Most economies are this type of economy
- Here the factors of production are independent of the govt.
- They produce on the basis of Market needs and competition
- The prices are variable depending on demand

<!-- Advantages of Market Economy -->
- Innovation
- Strong incentives for people to work harder

* China moved from a command to a market economy
** All countries are not completely market economy. The govt. has some say in areas like Healthcare etc.
** These are Mixed economies
