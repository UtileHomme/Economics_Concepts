<!-- What is MicroEconomics -->
- it is the study of individual actors
- these actors could be firms, households
- how actors make decisions / allocation of scarce resources (Eg - Food, Water, Labour)
- how does it affect prices and everything else
- how people think
- Finally we make some assumptions or simplify the above question-answers

<!-- What is MacroEconomics  -->
- the study of economy in aggregrate
- aggregate economy policy decisions
Eg - What is going to happen when you raise or lower taxes
- How does it affect the overall productivity

<!-- What is Scarcity -->
- Economics is the study of "how we allocate the scarce resources"
- If there's more demand for a scarce resource, determining who gets it, how much of it do they get
and what do they have to give up to get those scarce resources

Eg - Caviar (fish egss) is a scarce resource
- Even "labour" is a resource (it is a scarce resource)
